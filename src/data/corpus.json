If we assume that /ɛl/ is ‘last’ due to its proximity with /mun/ ‘night’, and that Ghor doesn’t use the relative pronoun ‘which’, then probably /tʁɑ̃.pøʒ/ is the verb.

The weird thing here being that /tøʁ/ comes at the end, although this could be more like literally ‘clients of mine’. I’m noticing that ‘have’ seems to be constructed by /i/ + noun. Not sure if that’s the case here – it might be a particular construction when saying ‘number + of + something’, like ‘number + dan i + something’. We also know /laj/ is ‘all’, so /ʒi.ʒi/ is probably the number nine.\nUDS: I believe that the phonetics “dan” and “i\" are conjoined into one sound to mean a plural form of an indefinite article (as mentioned in comments). And I’ve explained why “ply” might be phonetically similar to “peluche” which then translate to something serviced like “client”. “Jiji” is an especially weird case because if it’s not a whole word meaning nine it would either be a repetition to emphasize the number “ji”, or it’s a combination of two other number roots to make nine, but that would mean Ghor has a word for 4.5 which seems implausible.
